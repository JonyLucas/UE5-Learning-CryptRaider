# Crypt Raider
On this project, based on GameDev.tv course, I've learned more advanced C++ programming and components in Unreal Engine 5. 

Here I've learned new concepts for unreal engine development:
- Game Mode
- UWorld class
- Character Class
- Collision channel and Overlap events;
- Physics Handle;
- The new Unreal Enhanced Input;
- Input Map Context and Input Actions
- Scene Component and Actor Component
-  Level Design With modular components.
